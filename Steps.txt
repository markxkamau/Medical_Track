Great! Adding reminders for missed doses and a weekly review of treatment progress can be a helpful feature for patients using your application.

To implement the reminder feature, you can use a scheduler like Spring Scheduler or Quartz to schedule a job that sends a reminder to the patient at a specified time. The reminder can be sent via email, SMS, or push notification, depending on the patient's preference.

Here's an example of how you can implement a reminder feature using Spring Scheduler:

    Add the Spring Scheduler dependency to your project:

<<---- Code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-quartz</artifactId>
</dependency>

    Create a ReminderJob class that implements the Quartz Job interface:


public class ReminderJob implements Job {

    @Override
    public void execute(JobExecutionContext jobExecutionContext) {
        // Send reminder to patient
    }
}

    Configure the scheduler in your application by creating a QuartzConfig class:

typescript

@Configuration
public class QuartzConfig {

    @Bean
    public JobDetail reminderJobDetail() {
        return JobBuilder.newJob(ReminderJob.class)
                .withIdentity("reminderJob")
                .storeDurably()
                .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Trigger reminderJobTrigger() {
        return TriggerBuilder.newTrigger()
                .forJob(reminderJobDetail())
                .withIdentity("reminderTrigger")
                .withSchedule(CronScheduleBuilder.cronSchedule("0 0 9 ? * SUN")) // every Sunday at 9am
                .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public SchedulerFactoryBean schedulerFactoryBean() {
        SchedulerFactoryBean schedulerFactoryBean = new SchedulerFactoryBean();
        schedulerFactoryBean.setJobDetails(reminderJobDetail());
        schedulerFactoryBean.setTriggers(reminderJobTrigger());
        return schedulerFactoryBean;
    }
}
--------->>

In this example, the job is scheduled to run every Sunday at 9am, but you can customize the schedule to fit the patient's treatment plan.

To implement the weekly review of treatment progress, you can create a report that summarizes the patient's treatment progress for the past week, including any missed doses or side effects. You can then send this report to the patient via email or a push notification.

You can use a reporting tool like JasperReports or BIRT to generate the report, and schedule a job using Spring Scheduler or Quartz to send the report to the patient at a specified time.

I hope this helps you add the reminder and weekly review features to your Spring Boot application. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
